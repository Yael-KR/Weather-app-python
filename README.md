Weather App
This project began in Google Colab, where I initially wrote the core functionality.  
Later, I moved the code into PyCharm to continue development in a local environment.  
From that point on, I used Git for version control and documentation.

The project is a simple Streamlit application that displays current weather information  
based on the city entered by the user.

What the app does
- Takes the user's name and city as input  
- Retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API  

Displays:
- Current temperature  
- "Feels like" temperature  
- Humidity level  
- General weather condition  
- Provides a recommendation based on the current temperature
